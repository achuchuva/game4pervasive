      - You must be the new resident. Well met, stranger. Just as a flame needs fresh
        kindling, a little town like this can always use more good folk.

        this. I come from the mountains. '
      - Like you, I have not been in Pebblewick long. Let us make new lives here
        together, hm? At the edge of the world.
